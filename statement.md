## 🧩 1. Problem Statement

Hospitals handle a large amount of critical data every day — patient records, bed allocations, drug inventory, and more.  
Most of these operations are commonly prone to:

- Manual errors  
- Mismanaged records  
- Delayed updates  
- Lack of centralized access  
- Difficulty in exporting or analyzing data  

A beginner-friendly system was needed to **digitize and simplify** these administrative processes using basic Python logic and MySQL database connectivity.

The aim was to create a **lightweight, terminal-based Hospital Management System** to help staff perform essential tasks efficiently without relying on complex software.

## 🎯 2. Scope of the Project

This project focuses on the **core functionalities** required in a small to medium hospital setup.  
The system includes:

- Patient registration, updates, and viewing records  
- Bed availability tracking and assignment  
- Drug inventory management  
- Exporting reports in CSV format (for offline use or analysis)  
- A simple menu-driven CLI interface  

**What is NOT included** (for scope clarity):

- No GUI  
- No doctor/appointment module  
- No billing system  
- No authentication/roles  
- No automation or background services  

This helps keep the system focused, modular, and beginner-friendly.

## 👥 3. Target Users

The system is intended for:

- Hospital administrative staff  
- Ward managers  
- Pharmacy inventory handlers  
- Students learning Python + MySQL  
- Beginners exploring CRUD-based software development  

Additionally, the project is suitable for VIT academic submissions where simple DBMS integration is required.
