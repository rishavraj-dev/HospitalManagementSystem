##  1. Problem Statement

Hospitals have to manage a lot of work in day to day life from the patient management,bed management,drug management and many other   
Most of these operations are commonly prone to:

- errors due to manual written records  
- Mismanaged records  
- Delayed updates  
- Lack of centralized access  
- Difficulty in exporting or analyzing data  

A simple and working system is requred to **digitize and simplify** these administrative processes using basic Python logic and MySQL database connectivity.

The aim is  to create a **lightweight, terminal-based Hospital Management System** to help person working there to  perform essential tasks efficiently without relying on complex software.



##  2. Scope of the Project

This project focuses on the **core functionalities** required in a small or medium hospital setup .  
The system includes:

- Patient registration, updates, and viewing records  
- Bed availability tracking and assignment  
- Drug inventory management  
- Exporting reports in CSV format or in the format to open in excel files to print eaisly (for offline use or analysis)  
- A simple menu-driven command prompt interface  


##  3. Target Users

The system is intended for:

- Hospital administrative staff  
- Ward managers  
- Pharmacy inventory handlers  
- Students learning Python + MySQL  
- Beginners exploring the software devlopment
